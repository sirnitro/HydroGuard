# ✅ TODO – Hydroponics Monitoring & Maintenance System

This is a master checklist for the development of the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi-based hydroponics automation system.

---

## 📁 Planning & Requirements

- [x] Define monitored parameters
- [x] Select sensors and relays
- [x] Design system wiring and layout
- [x] Assign I/O pins for all components
- [x] Create complete Bill of Materials (BOM)

---

## 📁 Hardware Assembly

- [x] Mount sensors on breadboard or permanent case
- [x] Wire DHT11 sensor
- [x] Wire DS18B20 or analog water temp sensor
- [x] Wire water level sensor
- [x] Wire turbidity sensor
- [x] Wire pH sensor
- [x] Connect and test all relays
- [ ] Perform power-up test
- [ ] Validate sensor outputs via Serial Monitor
- [ ] Manually test each relay output

---

## 📁 Firmware Development

- [x] Initialize WiFi and onboard web server
- [ ] Implement sensor read loop
- [ ] Add logic to compare readings against thresholds
- [ ] Control relays based on sensor states
- [ ] Add EEPROM storage for threshold values
- [ ] Add EEPROM restore and reset logic
- [ ] Implement AJAX or endpoint for real-time data
- [ ] Add manual override control from web interface

---

## 📁 Web Interface Design

- [x] Build HTML/CSS layout for dashboard
- [ ] Display live sensor data in interface
- [ ] Show relay status indicators
- [ ] Add threshold input fields
- [ ] Add save button for new threshold settings
- [ ] Create manual pump control buttons
- [ ] Optimize for mobile viewing

---

## 📁 System Testing

- [ ] Simulate low water level and confirm relay triggers
- [ ] Simulate pH imbalance and validate correction logic
- [ ] Simulate nutrient threshold and trigger nutrient pump
- [ ] Confirm EEPROM restore works after power loss
- [ ] Validate timing to avoid relay overlap
- [ ] Run full system for 24–48 hours under load

---

## 📁 Enclosure & Deployment

- [ ] Design or purchase a waterproof enclosure
- [ ] Secure and mount electronics in case
- [ ] Route and waterproof sensor cables
- [ ] Attach and label probes in hydroponic system
- [ ] Final safety inspection and waterproofing

---

## 📁 Documentation & Community

- [ ] Create wiring diagram
- [ ] Write sensor calibration guide
- [ ] Document firmware update process
- [ ] Write and publish README.md, ROADMAP.md
- [ ] Optional: GitHub Pages live demo
- [ ] Optional: Blog/tutorial for replication

---

## 📁 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Charting & historical logging
- [ ] OTA firmware updates over WiFi
- [ ] Email/SMS notifications for critical readings
- [ ] Password protection for settings page
- [ ] Alexa or Google Assistant integration
- [ ] Secure remote access (ngrok/VPN)
