# 🛣️ Hydroponics Monitoring & Maintenance System — Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development phases, milestones, and future enhancements planned for the Hydroponics Monitoring & Maintenance System using the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Planning & Requirements (Complete)

- [x] Define all monitored parameters (temp, humidity, water level, pH, turbidity)
- [x] Select appropriate sensors and relays
- [x] Design system wiring and component layout
- [x] Finalize I/O pin assignments
- [x] Create Bill of Materials (BOM)

---

## 🔧 Phase 2: Hardware Assembly (In Progress)

- [x] Mount sensors on breadboard or enclosure
- [x] Wire all sensors and relays to Uno R4 WiFi
- [ ] Conduct initial power-up test
- [ ] Verify all sensor inputs via Serial Monitor
- [ ] Test relay activation manually

---

## 💻 Phase 3: Firmware Development

- [x] Setup WiFi and onboard web server
- [ ] Read and process all sensor values
- [ ] Store and apply threshold settings using EEPROM
- [ ] Implement relay control logic based on thresholds
- [ ] Add manual relay override from web interface
- [ ] Implement auto-refresh or AJAX endpoint for live data
- [ ] Add EEPROM reset-to-default function

---

## 🌐 Phase 4: Web Interface Design

- [x] Design minimal dashboard UI (HTML + CSS)
- [ ] Display real-time sensor data
- [ ] Show pump/relay statuses
- [ ] Include threshold configuration form
- [ ] Add Save/Update button to submit new thresholds
- [ ] Add manual relay toggle buttons
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness

---

## 🧪 Phase 5: Testing & Tuning

- [ ] Simulate out-of-bound sensor conditions
- [ ] Validate relay response accuracy
- [ ] Power cycle test (EEPROM restore)
- [ ] Conduct 24–48 hour system stability test
- [ ] Document known issues or limitations

---

## 📦 Phase 6: Enclosure & Deployment

- [ ] Design or purchase protective housing
- [ ] Waterproof cable management
- [ ] Secure all electronics for real-world use
- [ ] Label all connections
- [ ] Mount and install in live hydroponics system

---

## 📚 Phase 7: Documentation & Community

- [ ] Complete wiring diagram (`/docs/wiring_diagram.png`)
- [ ] Write sensor calibration guide
- [ ] Provide firmware update instructions
- [ ] Publish GitHub Pages demo (optional)
- [ ] Add tutorial/guide for others to replicate the project

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Planned)

- 📈 Add charting/history using SD card or cloud database
- 🛠 OTA firmware updates via WiFi
- 📧 Email/SMS alerts for critical thresholds
- 🔐 Password-protected settings page
- 🌱 Integration with Alexa/Google Assistant
- 🌍 Remote access via secure tunnel (e.g., ngrok or VPN)
